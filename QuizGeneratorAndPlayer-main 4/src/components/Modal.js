            <strong>Knowledge:</strong> recalling information or knowledge is the foundation of the pyramid and a precondition for all future levels.
            <br />
            <em>Example:</em> Name three common types of meat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Comprehension:</strong> making sense out of information
            <br />
            <em>Example:</em> Summarize the defining characteristics of steak, pork, and chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Application:</strong> using knowledge in a new but similar form
            <br />
            <em>Example:</em> Does eating meat help improve longevity?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong> taking knowledge apart and exploring relationships
            <br />
            <em>Example:</em> Compare and contrast the different ways of serving meat and compare health benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Synthesis:</strong> using information to create something new
            <br />
            <em>Example:</em> Convert an "unhealthy" recipe for meat into a "healthy" recipe by replacing certain ingredients. Argue for the health benefits of using the ingredients you chose as opposed to the original ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluation:</strong> critically examining relevant and available information to make judgments
            <br />
            <em>Example:</em> Which kinds of meat are best for making a healthy meal and why?
